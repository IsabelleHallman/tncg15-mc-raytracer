# Monte-Carlo ray-tracer
Project in the course TNCG15 - Advanced Global Illumination and Rendering. 

An implementation of a Monte-Carlo ray-tracer. When finished it should be possible to use and get good results for the following 
types of objects in the scene: 
* Transparent objects
* Perfectly reflecting objects 
* Lambertian reflectors 
* Oren-Nayar reflectors

The implementation is made by Isabelle Hallman and Rebecca Cedermalm through pair programming.
